TransitMix Presenter
======================

This is an attempt to build a PHP based presentation website that uses data from TransitMix.  This will be my attempt to learn how to play with JSON files.

In Plain English
======================

The goal behind this tool will be to take a map created with TransitMix - www.transitmix.net - and create "Plain English" descriptions of the routes that would allow transit planners and the general public a chance to better understand them.  It will be primarily used for my map located at http://app.transitmix.net/map/16170/ but I hope it is useful for anyone.
